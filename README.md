# protein-classification-service

This service takes an unaligned protein sequence as a query and returns a set of potential protein families.

## About
A protein family is a group of proteins which share function and evolutionary origin. These similarities are reflected in their sequence similarity, i.e. their conservation in primary structure (amino acid sequence).

##Â Running the service

This service assumes `docker` to be installed. To run this service, execute the following:

```bash
docker run ...
```
