description: |-
  Trained ResNet on the top 10,000 protein families in the PFAM seed random-split dataset. Training was slow (80 epochs).
  Due to Google colab, the training was continuously restarted from different points. The learning rate was adjusted
  (reduced) manually. Also, weight decay was reduced. For reference, the final weights were derived from the following
  runs (paths):
  1. 1sshyo10 (up to epoch 18)
  2. 1ma58t2x
  3. 14luj3nl
  4. 15mbz57z
  5. 2v9ehhgg
  6. 3l4yetd2
